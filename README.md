# pharo-platinum
A Platinum Theme for Pharo
  
**WARNING**: This is a work in progress. It is both not ready for anything besides experimental use and may, in fact, never be finished.
  
Contributions/help are most welcome!

## Installing / Using ##
For the moment, this will only work with **Pharo 6.1**.
  
To install, simply clone this repo in Iceberg and load the package within.
  
Then execute the following in a Playground:
```smalltalk
PlatinumTheme beCurrent.
```

## Quick Note on Fonts ##
When developing locally, I use Chicago and Charcoal fonts to really nail down the look. I have not included the TTF files for those fonts here, since I'm not sure what the copyright status is. Also these TTF fonts render oddly compared to the included image fonts, which is something else I need to work on.
  
## Help! ##
If you have any tips, advice, or suggestions I could use them all. I'm new to Polymorph.
